# Purpose
Chronicle is a data indexing tool that allows for answering important questions Hack Club has about its members - for instance:
* Who are active Hack Clubbers within driving distance of AngelHacks?
* Who came to Epoch and has contributed to Hack Club repos on GitHub?
* Who is new to Slack, but hasn't contributed a Sprig game?
* Who has a lot of expertise with Rust, but hasn't contributed to the Burrow project nor joined its channel?

# Components
Chronicle is split into two major components:
1. A suite of command line tools that load, transform, conflate, and ultimately sync data in a target Elasticsearch cluster
1. An Elasticsearch cluster w/ Kibana used for creating dashboards

# Usage
Access to Chronicle will be limited to a very small set of Hack Club HQ employees with a set of very strict use cases.

# Data
#### Data sources
Chronicle uses data from a variety of sources, including but not limited to:
* Airtable (leaders table, ops address table)
* Scrapbook DB
* Slack APIs
* Google Geocoding APIs
* Github APIs
* Pirateship
* Raw slack data exports (**ONLY** public data)

#### Data freshness
By design, Chronicle will not be designed in a way where new changes in underlying data will be synced to Elasticsearch promptly.  Instead, snapshots will be generated periodically from origin datasources, and then subsequently be consumed when we perform our next sync.

#### Data privacy
Given the sensitive nature of the data Chronicle uses, Chronicle is **not** a tool made for public consumption.  All data posted here in this repo is for purposes of testing and development is mock data not relating to any real person.

Please refer to Hack Club's official data policy guidelines [here](http://please.fill.me.in.com).
